        Is it supported to compile the JNI code as 32-bit shared libraries and
        use it in 64-bit compiled Java code ?

  message:
    "\n Java native libraries might not run in a cloud or container environment.\n\n
    Recommendations\n\n * Review the purpose of the native library in your application.\n
    * Check whether the native library is compatible with a cloud environment.\n *
    Reuse or embed the native library or application in a cloud environment, for example,
    in a JBoss module.\n * Replace, remove, or rewrite the native library or application
    using a cloud-compatible equivalent.\n "
