## Reasoning

To migrate the Java EE Message Driven Bean (MDB) to Quarkus, we need to address the issue identified by the static code analysis, which is the use of `@MessageDriven` annotation. Quarkus does not support EJBs, and therefore we need to use CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) beans instead.

Here are the steps we will follow:

1. Replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped` to define the bean as a CDI managed bean with application scope.
2. Remove the `MessageListener` interface and its `onMessage` method signature, as Quarkus uses the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging API for handling messages.
3. Use the `@Incoming` annotation to mark the method that will be invoked for each message received on the specified channel.
4. Replace the `Logger` from `java.util.logging` with `io.quarkus.logging.Log` which is the preferred logging framework in Quarkus.
5. Remove the `ActivationConfigProperty` annotations as they are specific to EJBs and not needed in Quarkus.
6. Update the `pom.xml` to include the Quarkus Reactive Messaging dependency if not already present.
7. Ensure that the application properties or configuration files are updated to define the connection to the message broker and the channel configuration.

Now, let's proceed with the migration.

## Updated File

```java
package org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb;

import io.quarkus.logging.Log;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;

/**
 * <p>
 * A simple bean that asynchronously receives and processes the messages that are sent to the queue using Quarkus.
 * </p>
 *
 * @author Serge Pagop (spagop@redhat.com)
 */
@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloWorldQueueMDB {

    @Incoming("HELLOWORLDMDBQueue")
    public void onMessage(String msg) {
        Log.info("Received Message from queue: " + msg);
    }
}
```

### Additional Notes:

- The `@Incoming` annotation's value should match the name of the channel configured in the `application.properties` file for the incoming messages from the queue.
- The `pom.xml` file should include the `quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging` dependency to enable MicroProfile Reactive Messaging:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

- The `application.properties` file should be updated to include the configuration for the message broker and the channel, for example:

```properties
mp.messaging.incoming.HELLOWORLDMDBQueue.connector=smallrye-jms
mp.messaging.incoming.HELLOWORLDMDBQueue.destination=queue/HELLOWORLDMDBQueue
```

- Ensure that the message broker is properly configured and accessible from the Quarkus application.
