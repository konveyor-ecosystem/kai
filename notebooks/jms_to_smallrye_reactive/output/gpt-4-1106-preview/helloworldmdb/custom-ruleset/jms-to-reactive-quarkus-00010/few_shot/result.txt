## Reasoning

To migrate the Java EE Message Driven Bean (MDB) to Quarkus, we need to address the issue identified by the static code analysis. The `@MessageDriven` annotation is not supported in Quarkus, and we need to use Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) instead. Here are the steps we will take:

1. Replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped` to define the bean as a CDI managed bean with application scope.
2. Use MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to handle the JMS messages. This is done by using the `@Incoming` annotation to mark the method that will receive the messages.
3. Replace the Java Util Logging with Quarkus logging (`io.quarkus.logging.Log`) for consistency with Quarkus standards.
4. Remove the `MessageListener` interface and its `onMessage` method signature, as it is specific to Java EE MDBs and not required in Quarkus.
5. The `ActivationConfigProperty` annotations are no longer needed because the configuration will be handled differently in Quarkus, typically through the `application.properties` file.
6. Update the `pom.xml` file to include the Quarkus Reactive Messaging dependency if it's not already present.

The solved example shows how the MDB is converted to a CDI bean and uses MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to consume messages. We will follow a similar pattern for the input file.

## Updated File
```java
package org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb;

import io.quarkus.logging.Log;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;

/**
 * <p>
 * A simple bean that asynchronously receives and processes the messages that are sent to the queue.
 * </p>
 *
 * @author Serge Pagop (spagop@redhat.com)
 */
@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloWorldQueueMDB {

    @Incoming("HELLOWORLDMDBQueue")
    public void receiveMessage(String messageText) {
        Log.info("Received Message from queue: " + messageText);
    }
}
```

### Notes on pom.xml and Configuration
- Ensure that the `quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging` dependency is included in the `pom.xml` file.
- The `application.properties` file should contain the configuration for the message queue, similar to the `ActivationConfigProperty` values from the original Java EE code. For example:
  ```
  mp.messaging.incoming.HELLOWORLDMDBQueue.connector=smallrye-jms
  mp.messaging.incoming.HELLOWORLDMDBQueue.destination=queue/HELLOWORLDMDBQueue
  ```
- The `connector` property would depend on the specific JMS connector being used in the Quarkus application.
- The `destination` property should match the JNDI name of the JMS queue.

By following these steps and making the necessary updates, the Java EE MDB should be successfully migrated to a Quarkus application.
