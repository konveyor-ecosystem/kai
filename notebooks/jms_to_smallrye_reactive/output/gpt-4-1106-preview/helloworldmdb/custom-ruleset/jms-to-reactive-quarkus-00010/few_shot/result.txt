## Reasoning

To migrate the Java EE Message Driven Bean (MDB) to Quarkus, we need to follow these steps:

1. Replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation. In this case, we will use `@ApplicationScoped` as suggested by the static code analysis issue. This is because Quarkus does not support EJBs and instead uses CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) for its beans.

2. Remove the `MessageListener` interface and its `onMessage` method signature. In Quarkus, we will use the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging API to handle the messages.

3. Add the `@Incoming` annotation to the method that will process the messages. This annotation will specify the channel that the method will listen to.

4. Replace the Java Util Logging with Quarkus logging. Quarkus uses its own logging framework that integrates with its CDI model.

5. Update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary dependencies for Quarkus and MicroProfile Reactive Messaging. This will likely involve adding the `quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging` dependency.

6. Update any imports that are no longer valid or required in Quarkus.

Following these steps, we will transform the Java EE MDB into a Quarkus bean that is capable of handling messages reactively.

## Updated File

```java
package org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb;

import io.quarkus.logging.Log;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;

/**
 * <p>
 * A simple bean that asynchronously receives and processes the messages that are sent to the queue.
 * </p>
 *
 * @author Serge Pagop (spagop@redhat.com)
 */
@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloWorldQueueMDB {

    @Incoming("HELLOWORLDMDBQueue")
    public void onMessage(String msg) {
        Log.info("Received Message from queue: " + msg);
    }
}
```

### Notes on the Migration:

- The `@Incoming` annotation's value should match the name of the channel configured in the `application.properties` file for the Quarkus application. This channel name is typically the same as the JMS destination name used in the original Java EE application, but it might need to be adjusted based on the configuration of the message broker in the Quarkus environment.
- The `pom.xml` file must be updated to include the Quarkus BOM and the `quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging` dependency. This is not shown in the code snippet above but is a necessary step in the migration process.
- The `application.properties` file in Quarkus will need to be updated with the appropriate configuration for connecting to the message broker and defining the channel used by the `@Incoming` annotation.
- The `Logger` has been replaced with `Log` from Quarkus logging, which is a static logger that does not require instantiation.
- The `Message` and `JMSException` imports, as well as the `MessageListener` interface, have been removed since they are not used in the Quarkus implementation.
- The exception handling that was present in the Java EE code is not shown in the Quarkus code. If message processing can throw exceptions, appropriate error handling should be added to the Quarkus method.
