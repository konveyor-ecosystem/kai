## Reasoning

To migrate the Java EE Message Driven Bean (MDB) to Quarkus, we need to follow the pattern shown in the solved example. Here are the steps we will take:

1. **Remove Java EE-specific annotations**: The `@MessageDriven` annotation and its `activationConfig` properties are specific to Java EE and are not used in Quarkus. Instead, Quarkus uses the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging API for handling messages.

2. **Add Quarkus-specific annotations**: We will use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to define the bean as a CDI managed bean with application scope. We will also use the `@Incoming` annotation to indicate the channel from which the messages will be consumed.

3. **Update the `onMessage` method**: In Quarkus, the method annotated with `@Incoming` takes the message payload directly, rather than a `Message` object. This means we can simplify the method signature and remove the JMS-specific code.

4. **Update logging**: We will replace the usage of `java.util.logging.Logger` with `io.quarkus.logging.Log`, which is the Quarkus logging facility.

5. **Update the `pom.xml`**: We need to ensure that the `pom.xml` file includes the necessary dependencies for Quarkus and MicroProfile Reactive Messaging. This includes dependencies like `quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-jms`.

6. **Configuration**: We need to add configuration properties to `application.properties` to define the connection to the JMS broker and the queue name. This replaces the `destinationLookup` property from the `@ActivationConfigProperty`.

Now, let's apply these steps to the provided input file.

## Updated File

```java
package org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb;

import io.quarkus.logging.Log;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;

/**
 * <p>
 * A simple bean that asynchronously receives and processes the messages that are sent to the queue.
 * </p>
 *
 * @author Serge Pagop (spagop@redhat.com)
 */
@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloWorldQueueMDB {

    @Incoming("helloworld-queue")
    public void onMessage(String msg) {
        Log.info("Received Message from queue: " + msg);
    }
}
```

### Additional Configuration in `application.properties`

```properties
# Configure the incoming channel for the queue
mp.messaging.incoming.helloworld-queue.connector=smallrye-jms
mp.messaging.incoming.helloworld-queue.destination=HELLOWORLDMDBQueue
```

### Changes to `pom.xml`

Ensure that the following dependencies are included in the `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-jms</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

This migration assumes that the Quarkus application is already set up with the necessary configurations for connecting to a JMS broker. If not, additional configurations and dependencies may be required.
