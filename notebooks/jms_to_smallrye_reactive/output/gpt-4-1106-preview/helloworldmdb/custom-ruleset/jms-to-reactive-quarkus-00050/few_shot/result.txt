## Reasoning

To migrate the Java EE Message Driven Bean (MDB) to a Quarkus equivalent, we need to address the issue identified by the static code analysis: replacing JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements with Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents.

Here are the steps we will follow:

1. **Replace Imports**: We will replace the JavaEE JMS imports with the appropriate MicroProfile Reactive Messaging imports.

2. **Update the Bean Definition**: In Quarkus, we use CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) beans instead of EJBs. We will annotate the class with `@ApplicationScoped` to define it as a CDI bean.

3. **Configure the Message Listener**: We will use MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to listen for messages. This involves using `@Incoming` to denote the incoming channel that the method will listen to.

4. **Update the Logger**: We will use JBoss Logging which is the preferred logging framework in Quarkus.

5. **Update the Message Processing Method**: We will change the method signature to accept the message payload directly, as MicroProfile Reactive Messaging allows us to do so.

6. **Update the pom.xml**: We need to ensure that the Quarkus SmallRye Reactive Messaging extension is included in the `pom.xml` file.

7. **Remove the `MessageDriven` Annotation**: This annotation is specific to Java EE and is not used in Quarkus.

8. **Application Configuration**: We will need to configure the application properties to define the connection to the JMS broker and the destination queue.

Now, let's apply these changes to the provided Java EE MDB code to migrate it to Quarkus.

## Updated File
```java
package org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb;

import org.jboss.logging.Logger;
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;

/**
 * A simple bean that asynchronously receives and processes the messages that are sent to the queue.
 */
@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloWorldQueue {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(HelloWorldQueue.class);

    /**
     * The method that will be called when a message is received.
     * @param rcvMessage The received message
     */
    @Incoming("hello-world-queue")
    public void onMessage(String rcvMessage) {
        LOGGER.info("Received Message from queue: " + rcvMessage);
    }
}
```

### Additional Notes:
- The `@Incoming` annotation's value "hello-world-queue" is a channel name that should be configured in the `application.properties` file to map to the actual JMS queue.
- The `application.properties` file should contain the configuration for the JMS broker and the destination queue. For example:
  ```
  mp.messaging.incoming.hello-world-queue.connector=smallrye-jms
  mp.messaging.incoming.hello-world-queue.destination=queue/HELLOWORLDMDBQueue
  ```
- The `smallrye-jms` connector is a hypothetical connector name. The actual connector name and configuration properties will depend on the JMS broker you are using with Quarkus.
- Ensure that the Quarkus SmallRye Reactive Messaging extension is added to the `pom.xml` file:
  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  ```
- The `Logger` import has been updated to use JBoss Logging, which is the preferred logging framework in Quarkus.
- The `onMessage` method now directly accepts a `String` instead of a `Message` object. This simplifies the code as the payload conversion is handled by the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging framework. If you need to process different message types or access message headers, you can adjust the method signature accordingly.
