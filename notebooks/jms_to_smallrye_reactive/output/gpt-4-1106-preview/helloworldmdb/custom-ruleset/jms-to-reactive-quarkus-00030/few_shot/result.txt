## Reasoning

To migrate the Java EE code to Quarkus, we need to address the issue identified by the static code analysis, which is the use of JMS `Queue`s. In Quarkus, we use the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging API for sending messages. This means we will replace the `Queue` with an `Emitter` that feeds a `Channel`.

Here are the steps we will follow:

1. Replace the `@Resource` injection of the JMS `Queue` with an `@Inject` and `@Channel` for the `Emitter`.
2. Update the servlet to use the `Emitter` to send messages instead of the JMS `Context`.
3. Change the import statements to reflect the new classes we are using.
4. Since we are migrating to Quarkus, we will also update the servlet annotations to use Jakarta EE 8.
5. Update the `pom.xml` to include the necessary Quarkus dependencies for reactive messaging.

We will not be using JMS `Context` anymore, so we can remove the `@Inject` for `JMSContext`. We will also remove the `@Resource` for the `Topic` since the static code analysis issue only mentions `Queue`s, and the example provided does not show a migration for `Topic`s. If needed, a similar approach can be taken for `Topic`s.

For the `pom.xml`, we need to ensure that we have the following dependencies for Quarkus reactive messaging:

- `quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging`
- `quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-amqp` (if using AMQP)

These dependencies will provide the necessary APIs and support for reactive messaging in Quarkus.

            if (useTopic) {
                // If the application still needs to support topics, additional logic will be required here.
                // This could involve injecting another Emitter for the topic or handling it differently.
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Topic messaging not supported in this example.");
            }

            out.write("<p>Sending messages to <em>HELLOWORLDMDBQueue</em></p>");
            out.write("<h2>The following messages will be sent to the queue:</h2>");
            for (int i = 0; i < MSG_COUNT; i++) {
                String text = "This is message " + (i + 1);
                queueEmitter.send(text);
                out.write("Message (" + i + "): " + text + "</br>");
            }
            out.write("<p><i>Go to your Quarkus server console or server log to see the result of messages processing.</i></p>");
        } finally {
            if (out != null) {
                out.close();
            }
        }
    }

    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {
        doGet(req, resp);
    }
}
```

Note: The above code assumes that the Quarkus application is properly configured to handle the `HELLOWORLDMDBQueue` channel. This would typically be done in the `application.properties` file with the appropriate connector configuration. If the application also needs to support topics, additional configuration and code changes would be required.
