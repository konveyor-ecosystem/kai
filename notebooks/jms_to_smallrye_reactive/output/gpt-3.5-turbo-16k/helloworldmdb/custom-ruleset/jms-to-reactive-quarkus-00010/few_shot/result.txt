## Reasoning
1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the `@MessageDriven` annotation is not supported in Quarkus and needs to be replaced with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.
2. Looking at the solved example, we can see that the `@MessageDriven` annotation was replaced with `@ApplicationScoped`.
3. We need to update the import statements to use the correct annotations for Quarkus. The import statements for `@MessageDriven`, `@ActivationConfigProperty`, `@Message`, `@MessageListener`, and `@TextMessage` should be removed. Instead, we need to import `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` for the `@Incoming` annotation and `io.quarkus.logging.Log` for the logging statement.
4. The `onMessage` method should be updated to accept a `String` parameter instead of a `Message` parameter. The logging statement should also be updated to use `Log.info` instead of `LOGGER.info`.
