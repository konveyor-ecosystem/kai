## Reasoning
1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the `@MessageDriven` annotation is not supported in Quarkus and needs to be replaced with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.
2. In the solved example, the `@MessageDriven` annotation in the `HelloWorldMDB` class was replaced with `@ApplicationScoped`.
3. The `MessageListener` interface is no longer needed in Quarkus, so it can be removed.
4. The `LOGGER` instance can be replaced with Quarkus' logging API, such as `io.quarkus.logging.Log`.
5. The `onMessage` method can be updated to use the `@Incoming` annotation to specify the incoming message channel and the method parameter can be changed to `String` to match the message type.
6. The `TextMessage` class and the `JMSException` class can be removed as they are not needed in Quarkus.

## Updated File
```java
package org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb;

import io.quarkus.logging.Log;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;

@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloWorldQueueMDB {

    @Incoming("HELLOWORLDMDBQueue")
    public void onMessage(String msg) {
        Log.info("Received Message from queue: " + msg);
    }
}
```
