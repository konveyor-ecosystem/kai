## Reasoning
1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that the `@MessageDriven` annotation is not supported in Quarkus and needs to be replaced with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.
2. In the solved examples, the `@MessageDriven` annotation is replaced with `@ApplicationScoped`.
3. The `@Incoming` annotation is used in the solved examples to specify the incoming channel for the message listener method. We will use this annotation to replace the `onMessage` method.
4. The solved examples also show changes in imports. We will update the imports accordingly.
