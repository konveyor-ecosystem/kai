## Reasoning
1. The issue found in the Java EE code is that it is using the `@MessageDriven` annotation, which is not supported in Quarkus. Instead, we need to use a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.
2. The `@MessageDriven` annotation is used to define a message-driven bean (MDB) in Java EE. MDBs are used to asynchronously receive and process messages. In Quarkus, we can achieve the same functionality using CDI beans with the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation.
3. The `@ActivationConfigProperty` annotations are used to configure the activation properties of the MDB. These properties define the behavior of the MDB, such as the destination lookup, destination type, and acknowledge mode.
4. The `MessageListener` interface is implemented by the MDB to define the `onMessage` method, which is invoked when a message is received.

## pom.xml Updates
Since we have changed the scope of the bean from `@MessageDriven` to `@ApplicationScoped`, we need to update the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary CDI dependencies. Specifically, we need to add the following dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.enterprise</groupId>
    <artifactId>cdi-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.SP1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.inject</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.inject</artifactId>
    <version>1</version>
</dependency>
```

These dependencies provide the necessary CDI APIs and annotations for the `@ApplicationScoped` bean.
