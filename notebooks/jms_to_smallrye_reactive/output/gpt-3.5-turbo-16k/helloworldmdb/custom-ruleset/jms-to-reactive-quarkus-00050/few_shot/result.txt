## Reasoning
1. The issue found from static code analysis is that "References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents."
2. Looking at the input file, the issue first appears on line 22 where the `javax.jms.Message` import is used.
3. To fix this issue, we need to replace the `javax.jms.Message` import with the Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalent.
4. The Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalent for `javax.jms.Message` is `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Message`.
5. We also need to update the `onMessage` method signature to use the Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalent for `javax.jms.Message`.
6. The Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalent for `javax.jms.MessageListener` is `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming`.
7. We need to update the `HelloWorldQueueMDB` class to use the Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile annotations for message-driven beans.
